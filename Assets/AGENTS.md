# Unity Game Project
## 1. Overview
This project is a Unity-based 2D Survival RPG game.

## 2. Top-level modules

- `Alchemy/` – Brewing, potion effects, crop/fertilizer logic, and shared alchemy services.
- `Attribute/` – Core attribute definitions and helpers shared by characters and items.
- `Character/` – Player-centric logic such as abilities, stats, state machines, and related UI.
- `Damageable/` – Components and utilities for entities that can take damage.
- `Drop/` – Loot drop logic, including drop tables.
- `Enemy/` – Enemy data, behaviours, spawners, and ability implementations.
- `GameState/` – High-level state containers and NPC state tracking.
- `Interactable/` – World interactables like herbs and resource nodes.
- `Inventory/` – Inventory systems (backend, frontend, equipment, merchant inventory, etc.).
- `Items/` – Item definitions, JSON importers, and helper utilities for item data.
- `Managers/` – Global managers (database, update loops, shared services).
- `Map/` – Map generation, control, triggers, spawn points, and exits.
- `Movement/` – Movement-related scripts for characters and entities.
- `NPC/` – Non-player character logic, gates, and frontend/back-end controllers.
- `Places/` – Location and place definitions referenced throughout the world.
- `UserInterface/` – UI systems beyond the player-only UI (boards, general widgets, etc.).
- `Utilities/` – Shared helpers: generic UI utilities, save/load, service locator, state machine base classes.
- `Weapon/` – Weapon-specific scripts and mechanics.

## 3. Coding Conventions
Follow GRASP coding principles if applicable:
GRASP Principles with Situations
- Information Expert: When you need to decide which class should perform a calculation, validation, or update, assign the responsibility to the class that already holds the necessary data. Example: if Order knows all its LineItems, then Order should calculate the total price, not Customer or LineItem.
- Creator:When an object A contains or closely works with objects of type B, let A be responsible for creating B. Example: if Order aggregates many LineItems, then Order should create LineItem instances instead of delegating that to some unrelated factory.
- Controller:When the system receives an external event (UI action, API request), assign the handling to a controller object that coordinates between UI and domain objects. Example: when a user clicks "Place Order," a OrderController should validate input and delegate to domain classes, rather than the UI button directly invoking Order.
- Low Coupling:When connecting two classes, check if one can operate without knowing the internals of the other. Prefer interfaces, dependency injection, or intermediaries to minimize hard links. Example: instead of Order calling PayPalService directly, inject a PaymentProcessor interface that can be swapped out later.
- High Cohesion:When adding responsibilities to a class, verify that they all serve a single, focused purpose. If not, split them. Example: don’t let Order also handle logging and email notifications—move those to separate classes.
- Polymorphism:When behavior changes depending on type, use polymorphism instead of conditional logic. Example: instead of if paymentType == CREDIT_CARD ... else if paymentType == PAYPAL, define CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment subclasses implementing a process() method.
- Pure Fabrication: When no natural class should take on a responsibility, create a new one to keep cohesion and coupling balanced. Example: if many domain objects need to log events, introduce a Logger utility class instead of polluting each domain class with logging code.
- Indirection: When two classes are tightly connected, add an intermediary to reduce direct coupling. Example: instead of Order talking to Database directly, insert a Repository class that manages persistence.
- Protected Variations: When you expect parts of the system to change (e.g., database engine, payment service), isolate them behind stable interfaces. Example: define a PaymentProcessor interface so you can switch from PayPal to Stripe without touching the rest of the code.
Use Design Patterns Appropriately
  Use patterns only when specific forces are present. Triggers first, anti-triggers second. Keep the simplest design unless a trigger fires.
1. Strategy：
- Trigger: One behavior with ≥3 variants; variant chosen at runtime; variants evolve independently; large if/else on type. 
- Avoid if: Only 1–2 stable variants; compile-time choice is fine.
2. Observer (Pub-Sub)
- Trigger: One source, many unknown listeners; need decoupled fan-out; events outlive the source; plugins.
- Avoid if: Exactly one consumer; tight ordering required.
3. Factory Method
- Trigger: A base class must decide which subclass to create for itself; product choice depends on subclass.
- Avoid if: Clients can new concrete types directly without coupling harm.
4. Abstract Factory
- Trigger: Families of related products must be created together and swapped as a set (e.g., UI themes, DB drivers).
- Avoid if: Products are mixed freely across families.
5. Builder
- Trigger: Object has many optional parameters, staged validation, or assembly steps; immutability desired.
- Avoid if: Simple DTO with ≤3 params.
6. Singleton
- Trigger: Exactly one global, stateless service with shared resource coordination (rare: clock, config).
- Avoid if: Tests need isolation; hidden global state. Prefer DI container.
7. Adapter
- Trigger: Third-party or legacy API is incompatible and unchangeable; you must present your interface.
- Avoid if: You control both sides; just change one side.
8. Facade
- Trigger: Subsystem with many types; clients need a narrow entry point and fewer dependencies.
- Avoid if: It adds no real simplification.
9. Decorator
- Trigger: Add responsibilities per instance at runtime; combinations explode with inheritance; open/closed needed.
- Avoid if: One fixed variant; subclassing is simpler.
10. Proxy
- Trigger: Same interface but with lazy loading, remote access, access control, or caching.
- Avoid if: It’s a pass-through with no policy.
11. Command
- Trigger: Actions must be queued, logged, retried, scheduled, or undone/redone; macro commands.
- Avoid if: One immediate call with no history.
12. Template Method
- Trigger: Algorithm skeleton is fixed; 2+ steps vary across subclasses; compile-time selection OK.
- Avoid if: Variants must switch at runtime → use Strategy.
13. State
- Trigger: Object behavior changes by discrete states; clear transition table; many if (state) branches.
- Avoid if: Two booleans suffice; states rarely change.
14. Composite
- Trigger: Tree structures where clients treat leaf and group uniformly (menus, scenes, org charts).
- Avoid if: Data is flat. 
15. Repository (enterprise)
- Trigger: Need a domain-level persistence boundary with intent-revealing queries and aggregates.
- Avoid if: Thin CRUD over a single table; a DAO is enough.
16. Dependency Injection
- Trigger: Components depend on abstractions; tests need fakes; runtime wiring varies.
- Avoid if: Small script or single module.
17. MVC/MVP/MVVM
- Trigger: UI where testability and separation of concerns matter; multiple view implementations.
- Avoid if: Trivial screen logic.
## Pre-check before any pattern
Is there a measurable pain now? (branch explosion, change ripple, hard-to-test code, plugin need)
Will this reduce coupling or increase cohesion?
Can a simpler refactor solve it? (extract function, split module, parameterize)
